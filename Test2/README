Design test cases for a storage array. The array has the following functionalities:
    . Create one or multiple LUN's.
    . Resize (expand) a LUN.
    . Export a LUN to a host.
    . Un-export a LUN.
    . Remove an un-exported LUN.
    . Retrieve the information(size, export) of a LUN.
    . Concurrent requests is supported.
    . Performance is not impacted no matter how many LUN's are created and exported.
